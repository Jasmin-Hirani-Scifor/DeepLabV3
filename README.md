# Document Sementic Segmentation using DeepLabV3
This repository contains DeepLabV3 Deep learning computer vision semantic segmentation project created by Jasmin Hirani during March-April 2024.

Document Scanning is a background segmentation problem that can be solved using various methods. It is one of the extensively used applications of computer vision. In this project, I'm considering Document Scanning as a deep learning-based semantic segmentation problem. This project will show how to load and train DeepLabv3 in PyTorch for Document Segmentation on a synthetic dataset. Models can be used and deployed using streamlit app.
